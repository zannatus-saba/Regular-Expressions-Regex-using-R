Write a single regular expression that will capture every version of the name in all four lists. I will want to create a single string with all the names. 

Adverbs and Adjectives 

Using the data file sentences contained in stringr, create a regular expression that captures all adverbs ending in ly which proceeds a word it modifies.

Once completed, for all the adverbs identified, create a regular expression that captures words modified by those adverbs. Be sure to remove words such as the, a, and, by, etc. Make sure this is written as a single pattern
